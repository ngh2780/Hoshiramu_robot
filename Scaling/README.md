## Hoshiramu_robot model Iktesting problem
opinion: left leg and hip work well but right leg can't work properly so the model seems jumping<br>
tested: - take off gravity(attached force)<br>
        - adding tail marker<br>
        - switching the position of leg_marker<br>

other plan: - the factor of the muscle(Mckibben muscle)<br>
            - modify markers again(?)
