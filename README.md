## 1. Research Overview
We are creating a musculoskeletal robot based on an actual case of a toy poodle with severe [Medial Patella Luxation (MPL)](https://www.qldvetspecialists.com.au/medial-patella-luxation). The musculoskeletal robot uses Thin McKibben PAM (Pneumatic Artificial Muscle) as actuators, which have characteristics similar to animal muscles, and essential muscles of the hind legs have been reproduced. Conventional computaitonal simulations defined muscles as lines without size connecting points to points, which had the flaw of not considering interactions between muscles and other tissues. However, this robot can overcome such flaws because it has physical muscles and skeleton. It is expected that applying this robot to orthopedic surgery will enable pre-surgical planning (determining angles for bone cutting, etc.), prognosis prediction, and rehearsal of surgical procedures.


To demonstrate the practicality (real-world applicability) of this research, we will compare and analyze the gait of three control groups: **1) normal hind leg**, **2) post-surgery hind leg**, and **3) pre-surgery hind leg**. (The method of analysis has not yet been determined.) For **2) post-surgery hind leg**, an actual veterinarian will perform the surgery. The input for gait will be the same for all groups. We will confirm that the gait of **2) post-surgery hind leg** is more natural than that of **3) pre-surgery hind leg**.

## 2. Workflow
This research is broadly classified into the following tasks and order:

1. **Robot construction**: Creating the musculoskeletal system and base of the robot
2. **Reproduction of gait motion**: Muscle control using electro-pneumatic regulators
3. **Comparison of gait motions**: Comparing gait motions of each control group under the same control input

Details are explained below.
